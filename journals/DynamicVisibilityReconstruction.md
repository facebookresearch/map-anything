## Overview
> In methods similar to MonST3R, point motion is not explicitly modeled. Instead, the dynamics of the dynamic point map are defined by the temporal visibility of points—that is, by their appearance and disappearance over time. A dynamic point cloud defined in this way can be represented as a tensor of shape $T\times W\times H \times 4$, where the additional channel encodes the visibility of each point.
